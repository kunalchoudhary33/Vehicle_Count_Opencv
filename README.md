Count of Cars and Two wheelers in each direction.

There are several ways to perform vehicle counting. Here is a simplest way to do this. 
Algorithm here is detection driven and without any use of standard data set for object recognition.


Language Used : Python - 3.6.5

Libraries Used : OpenCv - 4.0.0, Numpy - 1.13.1

Accuracy can be improved with the use of standard data set for recognition of cars and two wheelers.
